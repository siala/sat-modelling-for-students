- This library aims at modelling sat problems following the DIMACS CNF format
- It can be used to run a solver and to print the solutions (if any) in a user-friendly format
- Install a sat solver then update its path in students_lib.py
- I highly recommend to install the kissat solver https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat
- The library is implemented in the students_lib.py file 
- The variables and the clauses of the model should be declared using the 'model' class 
- A number of functions are provided to help the encoding of standard constraints
- A running example is given in example1.py
- To test example1.py: simply run 
- python3 example1.py
- Take some time to understand the library
- You are supposed to complete the students_lib.py file to encode the at least k constraint
- Use example2.py to test you encoding
